Portfolio Site

What is this?
-------------

This is a project completed as a part of the Udacity Full-stack Developer Nanodegree program.  A design mockup was provided, and the task was to mimic that mockup using HTML/CSS, and incorporate some of my own projects to create a personal portfolio.

How to use
----------

First, install the portfolio.html file, and the images/ and css/ directories all inside the same parent directory.  Then use a webbrowser to open the portfolio.html file.
